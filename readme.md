## UX Optimization Strategies üöÄ

At GitGift, we prioritize user experience. Here's a breakdown of the strategies we've employed to ensure a seamless interaction with our platform:

### 1. Gasless Transactions üå¨Ô∏è

One of the major pain points in the crypto world is the gas fees. We've eliminated this barrier by implementing ERC-4337 smart contract wallets using thirdweb, ensuring that the full value of the donation reaches the recipient.

**Implementation**: Check out our [account abstraction code here](https://github.com/AvinashNayak27/gitGift/commit/a9faffe7406186cd4155f4c45e3e70e200486a51) for a deep dive into how we've achieved gasless transactions.

### 2. Integrated Notifications üì¨

By creating GitHub issues for donations, we tap into the existing notification system of GitHub. This ensures that recipients are promptly informed without the need for additional infrastructure.

**Implementation**: Our [integrated notification system can be found here](https://github.com/AvinashNayak27/gitGift/commit/6e1f2540189094f9e8f554c256ffda776f68404a).

### 3. Sismo Connect Integration üîê

To ensure only legitimate recipients can claim donations, we've integrated Sismo Connect. This tool allows recipients to prove their GitHub account ownership in a privacy-preserving manner, adding an additional layer of security to the donation process.

**Implementation**: Our [sismo connect verify and claim code can be found here ](https://github.com/AvinashNayak27/gitGift/commit/c32d578fdedfbf9badd7291e0583c0d745fe503e)
